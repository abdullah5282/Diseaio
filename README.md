# Diseaio

## Description
This is a project that uses Flutter to create a beautiful and responsive UI design for a health app. The project showcases the use of Flutter widgets, animations, themes, and navigation to create a stunning user interface that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.

The project consists of the following screens:

- Splash screen: a simple screen that displays the app logo and name
- Login screen: Allows the user to sign in with their email and password or with Google
- Home screen: Welcomes the user and provides them with dialogue box for input of their symptoms. With Xray menu available at the top helps in uploading patient's Xray details.
- Details screen: After evaluating patient's sysmptoms our model predicts probable disease and proceeds further to give related information to the user about the same.


## How to run the project
To run the project, you need to have Flutter installed on your machine. You can follow the official documentation here :`https://docs.flutter.dev/` to install it.
Track to this destination: **./flask_backend/app.py** and 
open terminal and give cmd "flask run"

To execute the code, you can use any IDE that supports Flutter development, such as VS Code or Android Studio.<br>
Run `main.dart` file which contains the entry point for the app. <br>
The emulator will start and you will be greeted with a welcome screen. Further after logging in users can add their symptoms and Xray's for our ML model to start prediction and assist the users in receiving the best care.<br>

## Future Improvements
- We will be adding API's to get information about the nearest hospital and available doctors around the user's location, so that the patient's can get the treatment on time.<br>
- Also we are working to collaborate with hospitals and on call doctors to set appointments through the app itself, this will be immensely usefull to the user as they can get treatment virtually.
